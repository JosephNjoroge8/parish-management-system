# ðŸŽ‰ BRIDEGROOM/BRIDE TERMINOLOGY UPDATE COMPLETED

## âœ… **TERMINOLOGY TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE**

- âœ… Maintains backward compatibility with existing database records

### **3. MemberController.php Backend Updates** âœ…

- âœ… Maintains database compatibility while improving user interface clarity

## ðŸŽ¯ **EXACT MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE ALIGNMENT**

### **Form Sections Now Match Certificate:**

1. **BRIDEGROOM'S DETAILS** (shown for female members)
   - Bridegroom's name, age, residence, county
   - Marital status and occupation
   - Father's and Mother's complete information

2. **BRIDE'S DETAILS** (shown for male members)
   - Bride's name, age, residence, county
   - Marital status and occupation  
   - Father's and Mother's complete information

### **Field Mapping Exactly Matches Certificate:**
```
Certificate Field â†’ Form Field â†’ Database Field
husband_name â†’ bridegroom_name â†’ spouse_name (for female members)
wife_name â†’ bride_name â†’ spouse_name (for male members)
husband_age â†’ bridegroom_age â†’ spouse_age (for female members)
wife_age â†’ bride_age â†’ spouse_age (for male members)
... (and so on for all 12 detail fields)
```

## ðŸ”„ **SMART DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR**

### **Gender-Based Form Display:**

**For Male Members Registering:**
- Shows "ðŸ‘° BRIDE'S DETAILS" section
- Form asks for bride's information
- Data stored as spouse information in database

**For Female Members Registering:**
- Shows "ðŸ¤µ BRIDEGROOM'S DETAILS" section  
- Form asks for bridegroom's information
- Data stored as spouse information in database

### **Validation Logic:**
- **Married male members:** `bride_name` is required
- **Married female members:** `bridegroom_name` is required
- All other marriage fields (location, date, etc.) remain required for both
