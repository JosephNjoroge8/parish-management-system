## üìù Contributing Guidelines

### 1. Finding Issues to Work On

- Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/JosephNjoroge8/parish-management-system/issues)
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginners
- Issues labeled `help wanted` are ready for community contributions
- Feel free to propose new features by opening an issue first

### 2. Making Changes

#### Fork and Branch Strategy
```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/parish-management-system.git
cd parish-management-system

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
```

#### Branch Naming Conventions
- `feature/description` - for new features
- `fix/issue-description` - for bug fixes
- `docs/description` - for documentation changes
- `refactor/description` - for code refactoring
- `test/description` - for adding tests

### 3. Coding Standards

#### PHP Standards (Backend)
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add PHPDoc comments for classes and methods
- Write unit tests for new functionality

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

/**
 * Handles member management operations
 */
class MemberController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Store a new member in the database
     *
     * @param Request $request
     * @return \Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse
     */
    public function store(Request $request)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

#### JavaScript/TypeScript Standards (Frontend)
- Use ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Follow React best practices and hooks guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Write descriptive component and function names

```typescript
interface MemberFormProps {
    member?: Member;
    onSave: (member: Member) => void;
}

const MemberForm: React.FC<MemberFormProps> = ({ member, onSave }) => {
    // Component implementation
};
```

#### Database Standards
- Use descriptive migration names: `2024_01_15_create_members_table.php`
- Include rollback functionality in migrations
- Use proper foreign key constraints
- Add indexes for frequently queried columns

### 4. Testing Requirements

#### Backend Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test suite
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature
php artisan test --testsuite=Unit

# Run with coverage
php artisan test --coverage
```

#### Frontend Tests
```bash
# Run frontend tests
npm run test

# Run with watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

#### Test Guidelines
- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test both happy path and error cases
- Use meaningful test descriptions

### 5. Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update API documentation for new endpoints
- Include migration notes for breaking changes

### 6. Commit Guidelines

```
