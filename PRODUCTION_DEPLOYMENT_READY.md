## üéØ **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### 1. Git Repository Preparation
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Production ready: Complete system with optimizations"
git push origin Main
```

### 2. cPanel Deployment
```bash
# Run deployment script
./deploy.sh

# Or manual deployment:
# 1. Upload files via File Manager or Git
# 2. Run: composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
# 3. Run: php artisan migrate --seed
# 4. Run: php artisan config:cache
# 5. Set proper permissions: chmod -R 755 storage bootstrap/cache
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Run verification script
./verify-cpanel-setup.sh

# Manual checks:
# - Test login functionality
# - Verify reports generation
# - Check member registration
# - Test export functionality
```
